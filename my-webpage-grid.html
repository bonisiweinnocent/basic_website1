                <h3> City Hall</h3>
                <img src="cityHall.jpg" alt="City hall">
                <p>The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects
                    being
                    Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs
                    T.
                    Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings
                    was
                    imported from Europe.<br>
                    On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela made his
                    first public speech from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall.<br>
                    The City Hall's carillon was installed as a World War I war memorial, with 22 additional
                    bells being added in 1925 with the visit of the Prince of Wales.</p>

                <h3> Castle of Good Hope</h3>
                <img src="castle1.jpg" alt="Castle of Good Hope">
                <p>During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and the
                    former cells remain to this day.<br>
                    It is considered the best preserved example of a 17th century architectural structure in
                    the
                    entire world.<br>
                    The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.</p>

                <h3>District Six Museum</h3>
                <img src="museum1.jpg" alt="District 6">
                <p>Visitors learn about this once colourful hub for musicians, artists, and ‘good’ and ‘bad’
                    gangsters, that faced a 20-year long period of demolition and forced removals during the
                    apartheid era.</br>
                    Prior to its current purpose, it was a wine shop until the Methodists took it over in
                    1883
                    and founded the Buitenkamp Methodist Mission Church.</br>
                    Currently, the museum serves as a remembrance of the once lively multi-racial area that
                    was
                    forcefully removed during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
